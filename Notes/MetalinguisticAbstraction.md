# Chapter 4: Metalinguistic Abstraction

First paragraph is about how book has been about using languages to describe
problems and enable for solution to be constructed using the facilities afforded
by the language itself. Machine languages(Assembly) is the language for getting
computers to perform computations for the programmer, it is just one example on the
power of languages. The main tool in formulating a language for a particular problem
set is the evaluator/interpreter/compiler. It it is used to tell the machine
exactly what to do. To quote from the book.

> The evaluator, which determines the meaning of expressions in a programming language
> is just another program.

A programmer is as much a language designer, as a language user. Any program
contains the primitives and procedures required to solve some problem.

Final part of introduction is a description of the different sections in this
chapter.
