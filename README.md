# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs Notes

This repo contains my personal self study notes from reading the book by Abelson,
Sussman, and the other Sussman. To be more specific the second edition.

~~Currently stuck on chapter 2, skipped my last exercise. Will now focus on
learning computer systems and algorithms.~~

I am back from suffering in Algorithms land. By that I mean that I was procrastinating and doing other unrelated things. I was reading Art of Computer Programming and I got even more depressed because I could get fast enough to my true goal of writing my own Minecraft clone.

 Crafting Interpreters can be read before or after this book.
